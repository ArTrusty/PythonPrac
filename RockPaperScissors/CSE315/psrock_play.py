# Rock Paper Scissors
#
# Execute this file psrock_play.py to play a tournament.
# psrock.py implements the round robin tournament of rock paper scissors
# 
# Prior to execution:
# Line 22: Type each team's module name (the file name, but without the py) on the import statement,
# Lines 27-30: Create a reload() statement for each module, and
# Original line 36: Place each module name as an argument to the function psrock.round_robin().
# Each player should have their own .py file containing 
# a function called move(my_history, their_history)
# These filenames (without the .py extension) are passed to the 
# round_robin() function as the 2nd, 3rd, etc. arguments.

# Without reload(), changes to the .py file will be ignored unless the pyc 
# file is deleted and the kernel restarted.
